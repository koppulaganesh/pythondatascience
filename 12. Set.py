#Set: Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
'''
1.set is defined by curly brackets {}
2.it do not allow duplicates
3.No index, unordered, slicing is not possible
4.Do not allow mutable data types as set elements.
Note: Sets are unordered, so we cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
